As an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer, I am constantly looking for new and exciting ways to use Machine Learning to develop intelligent applications to improve the way people interact with each other and explore information. 

Over the past 5 years, I have actively explored many areas of STEM, such as Robotics and The Internet Of Things (IoT), and education. The experiences and skills Iâ€™ve acquired have allowed me to develop a strong foundation for my future career in Computer Science. This is why my focus is always on developing technology with a purpose. This philosophy is clearly reflected in the software and hardware projects I have taken on over the years and most recently in my work using Machine Learning.
