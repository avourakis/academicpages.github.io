I've spent the past year and a half working on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to develop intelligent applications to improve the way people interact with each other and explore information. I'm also on a mission to give back to the world by spreading Artificial Intelligence through my "AI for Everyone!" initiative.

For the past 5+ years, I have actively explored many areas of STEM, such as Robotics and The Internet Of Things (IoT), and education. The experiences and skills I've acquired have allowed me build a strong foundation for my future career in Computer Science. This is why my focus is always on developing technology with a purpose. This philosophy is clearly reflected on the software and hardware projects I've taken on over the years, and most recently, on my work using Machine Learning.
