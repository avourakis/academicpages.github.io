<strong>STEMbility</strong> is a non-profit organization that functions as a tech incubator for undergraduate students. It was co-founded by Sucha Kumar and myself on June 2015.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Our mission is to help undergraduate students acquire the Technical skills, Entrepreneurial skills, and Experiences they need to effectively join the competitive STEM workforce after graduation. This will be accomplished by using real-world applications combined with hands-on, project-based learning approaches.
